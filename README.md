# My portfolio

## Introduction

Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of my portfolio

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- MySQL (for creating the initial SQL table)
- [Any additional prerequisites]

## Getting Started

1. **Create Initial SQL Table**

    Run the following SQL script to create the initial table:

    ```sql
    -- Your SQL script here
    ```

2. **Create Connection.php**

    Create a `connection.php` file with the database connection details. Example:

    ```php
    <?php
    $host = "your_host";
    $username = "your_username";
    $password = "your_password";
    $database = "your_database";

    $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    ?>
    ```

3. **Use the Project**

    Start using the project by including the `connection.php` file in your PHP scripts and leveraging the initial SQL table.
